# A-BODY-SURVIVORS
We are a team of young Palestinians dedicated to sharing stories and narratives from Gaza that occurred during the October War on Gaza. Our mission is to convey the true picture of what is happening in Gaza today, through the testimonies of those who lived through the war and survived physically, but not without bearing deep emotional scars
